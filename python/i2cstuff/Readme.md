# Some of Bill's notes

## Exploring i2c on the Raspberry Pi 3 b+.

Following the Adafruit help files for the 16-bit ADC with i2c at 

https://www.adafruit.com/product/1085

and their recommendation of using the pypi / pip installs.

Circuit Python is Pip installable, https://pypi.org/search/?q=adafruit-circuitpython .

Blinka libraries https://circuitpython.org/blinka .

Found<br>
sudo pip3 install adafruit-circuitpython-ads1x15
and the website <br>
https://pypi.org/project/adafruit-circuitpython-ads1x15/

So far working fine.
