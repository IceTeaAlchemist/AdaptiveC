This is the PHP code and necessary executable files for the adaptive HTML interface.

readtographcore should be executed if the adaptivephp executable is being performed from elsewere, readtograph if it's in the same directory.

Keep in mind that executables need to have root access to function properly. Adaptivephptry will NOT work if setuid hasn't been performed.

Currently the php code has initiating the executable commented out, it just reads--i found using the terminal to initate the actual run to be less cumbersome.
