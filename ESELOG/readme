This is a C++/C library for controlling the QIAGEN ESELOG detector with a Raspberry Pi. This will probably ONLY work on Linux.

Additional functions can be added through adding shells with hard coded values to the generic qiagenread/qiagenwrite functions.

An example of both reading and writing is in qiagenlibrarytest.cpp.
